  # == Notes ==

  # - GitLab automatically passes artifacts from previous stages by default
  # - Set required secret variables at: https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/helpdesk-implementation/-/settings/ci_cd

  # = Secret variables
  #   Variables are grouped by section in KEY: "value" format (e.g. FOO: "bar")
  #   Where a variable should be protected (only accessible to the master branch, tags, its name is appended with
  #     '(protected)' (e.g. FOO (protected)`
  #   Where a variable is a file, it's name is appended with '(file)' and the value refers to the file that should be
  #     used as it's contents (e.g. FOO (file): "[contents of ./bar]"
  #   Sensitive values are represented by "[Sensitive]"
  #
  # - AWS IAM id/secret keys for 'bas-gitlab-ci-magic-helpdesk' user
  # > AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "[Sensitive]"
  # > AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "[Sensitive]"
